      <p>- hereinafter referred to as: Provider -</p>

      <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
      <p>
        These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply, after their inclusion, to all contracts for
        the purchase of goods, services, or other items (hereinafter "Goods") in the online shop at
        the above-mentioned URL in their valid version at the time of contract conclusion. These GTC
        apply exclusively. Deviating terms and conditions of the customer do not become part of the
        contract unless the provider expressly agrees to them.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Conclusion of Contract</h2>
      <p>
        2.1 The offers in the online shop constitute a non-binding invitation from the provider to
        the online shop visitors to submit an offer to purchase the goods offered in the shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2 The order of the goods is made through the online order form of the provider. After
        selecting the desired goods, entering all required information, and completing all other
        mandatory steps in the ordering process, the selected goods can be ordered by pressing the
        order button at the end of the checkout page (Order). By placing the order, the customer
        makes a binding contractual offer to purchase the selected goods. The contract is concluded
        when the provider accepts the customer's offer. The acceptance is made by the provider
        confirming the conclusion of the contract in written or text form (e.g., by email) (order
        confirmation) and sending this order confirmation to the customer or by delivering the
        ordered goods and sending these goods to the customer or by requesting payment from the
        customer (e.g., invoice or credit card payment in the ordering process) and sending the
        payment request to the customer. The decisive point for the time of conclusion of the
        contract is the time at which one of the alternatives mentioned in the first half-sentence
        occurs for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3 Before the binding submission of the order via the online order form of the provider,
        the customer can check their entries and correct them at any time using the usual keyboard,
        mouse, touch, or other input functions available. In addition, all entries will be displayed
        again in a confirmation window before the binding submission of the order and can also be
        corrected there using the usual keyboard, mouse, touch, or other available input functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.4 The provider will save the text of the contract after the conclusion of the contract and
        transmit it to the customer in text form (e.g., by email). The provider will not make the
        text of the contract accessible beyond this. If the purchase is made via a customer account
        in the online shop, the customer can view their orders and the associated order data there.
      </p>
      <p>2.5 The following languages are available for the conclusion of the contract: German.</p>

      <h2>3. Right of Withdrawal for Consumers</h2>
      <p>
        Consumers generally have a right of withdrawal in the case of contracts concluded outside
        business premises and in the case of distance contracts. A consumer is any natural person
        who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly neither commercial nor
        self-employed. Details can be found in the withdrawal instructions, which are made available
        to every consumer at the latest immediately before the conclusion of the contract.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Payment, Default</h2>
      <p>
        4.1 The prices listed in the online shop at the time of ordering apply. All prices include
        the statutory value-added tax plus any shipping costs listed. The customer will be informed
        about the available payment options in the online shop of the provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 If payment by credit or debit card is agreed, the purchase price is due immediately
        after the conclusion of the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 If payment via "PayPal" is agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after the
        conclusion of the contract. The payment processing is carried out by the payment service
        provider PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Retention of Title</h2>
      <p>
        The purchased goods remain the property of the provider until the purchase price has been
        fully paid.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Delivery and Reservation of Self-Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        6.1 Unless otherwise agreed, delivery will be made within the delivery time specified in the
        online shop to the delivery address specified by the customer. The applicable delivery times
        can be found in the online shop.
      </p>
      <p>6.2 Self-collection of the purchased goods is excluded.</p>
      <p>
        6.3 If the provider is unable to deliver the ordered goods because he has not been supplied
        without his own fault, even though he has concluded a congruent covering transaction with a
        reliable supplier in a timely manner, the provider will be released from his obligation to
        perform and can withdraw from the contract. The provider is obliged to inform the customer
        immediately about the impossibility of performance. Any consideration already provided by
        the contracting partner will be reimbursed to him immediately. Mandatory consumer rights
        remain unaffected by this paragraph.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Warranty</h2>
      <p>The provisions of the statutory liability for defects apply.</p>

      <h2>8. Liability</h2>
      <p>8.1 The provider is liable without limitation:</p>
      <p>
        for damages resulting from the violation of life, body, or health, which are based on an
        intentional or negligent breach of duty by the provider or an intentional or negligent
        breach of duty by a legal representative or vicarious agent of the provider; for damages
        based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the provider or on an
        intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or vicarious agent
        of the provider;
        <br />
        due to a guarantee promise, unless a different arrangement has been made in this regard;
        <br />
        due to mandatory liability (e.g., under the Product Liability Act).
      </p>
      <p>
        8.2 If the provider negligently breaches a material contractual obligation, his liability is
        limited to the contract-typical, foreseeable damage, unless unlimited liability applies
        according to the preceding paragraph. Material contractual obligations are obligations that
        the contract imposes on the provider according to its content for the purpose of achieving
        the purpose of the contract, the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the
        contract in the first place and on whose compliance the customer can regularly rely.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.3 Otherwise, the provider's liability, as well as the liability of his vicarious agents
        and legal representatives, is excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        The provider treats the personal data of its customers confidentially and in accordance with
        the statutory data protection regulations. Further details can be found in the provider's
        privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Final Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        10.1 The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the UN Sales Convention,
        to the extent that this choice of law does not lead to the deprivation of the consumer of
        mandatory statutory provisions of his country of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.2 If the customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under
        public law, the court at the registered office of the provider is competent, unless an
        exclusive place of jurisdiction is established for the dispute. This also applies if the
        customer has no place of residence within the European Union. The registered office of our
        company can be found in the heading of these GTC.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.3 Insofar as a provision of this contract is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, the
        remaining provisions of this contract remain unaffected.
      </p>
